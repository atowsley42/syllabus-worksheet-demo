You will need to purchase the book through cengage so that you have access to webassign.    You are expected to read the assigned section(s) from the text before each class meeting. Do not expect to understand the reading completely; your goal is to become aware of the ideas and vocabulary presented. What problems and processes are introduced? What questions are answered? You should then read a second time while working on the homework problems and a third time while studying for the quiz or test.      WebAssign  Homework and topic quizzes will be given through WebAssign .    Gradescope  Any written work will be graded and returned using gradescope .

Wellness  Mental health issues ebb and flow depending on current life events, and often surface at this time in life as young people encounter new complexities and stresses, sometimes without immediate support for the first time. This can be deeply frightening, or at least confusing. First and foremost, know that you are not alone. If you are feeling overwhelmed, if you experience what seems like depression or anxiety, or if you are feeling victimized in any way, RIT has people to help you. The most effective way to manage these challenges and minimize the effect on your work and personal life, is to recognize and talk about them before they become more intense. Please feel free to let me know if you need assistance connecting to services.

Notes   “If we could learn it all in a weekend we wouldn’t have semesters.”    You will be treated as adults in this course. You will not be tracked down to complete missing assignments, it is your job to do you work on time or to make arrangements if special circumstances arise.     "
