      Mental health issues ebb and flow depending on current life events, and often surface at this time in life as
      young people encounter new complexities and stresses, sometimes without immediate support for the first
      time. This can be deeply frightening, or at least confusing. First and foremost, know that you are not alone.
      If you are feeling overwhelmed, if you experience what seems like depression or anxiety, or if you are feeling
      victimized in any way, RIT has people to help you. The most effective way to manage these challenges and
      minimize the effect on your work and personal life, is to recognize and talk about them before they become
      more intense. Please feel free to let me know if you need assistance connecting to services. For counseling

          You will be treated as adults in this course. You will not be tracked down to complete missing
          assignments, it is your job to do you work on time or to make arrangements if special circumstances
          arise.
